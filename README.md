# Project documentation archiv
## _by Jan Echebiri_
This repository contains documentation (mostly as one pagers) for some of my past projects.
Feel free to browse around.

As of now, the following projects are included in this section:

### Kommunalplanung and Gamification (Komega Online):   
    
A simulation game made for multiple participants.
It lets players 'control' the smartphone of a politician and decide on choices for the local community budget in the best interest of the party.
